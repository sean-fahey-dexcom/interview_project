# Interview Project

## Note

These are instructions for the interview, not for the candidate. Candidate
instructions are comments in the code.

## Branches

There is a `solution` branch with examples, and a `collaboration` branch with
just the instructions and provided code. Checkout whichever is appropriate in
order to see the test questions.

### Java Problems

This directory contains 5 questions to test the candidate's familarity with some
basic Java functionality. For L1 & L2 testers, we're not looking for perfect,
or even working, code. We simply want the candidate to demonstrate that they're
familiar with the basics of the language. L3 testers should produce working
code to answer all questions and should be able to clearly explain their
approach.

Ideally the candidate should demonstrate:

- Using for loops correctly
- Using and understanding conditional if statements
- Using a variety of Java data types

### Python Problems

This directory contains 5 questions to test familarity with Python. If we are
testing the candidate on Python skills instead of Java skills, they should be
able to demonstrate at least an intermediate skill level. Their code should
work correctly, and they should be able to explain in detail what each step
does. We should not consider candidates above the L2 level on python skills
alone.

Ideally the candidate should demonstrate:

- Correctly using for loops.
- Correctly implimenting if, elif, and else statements.
- Selecting the most appropriate data type for each given problem.
- Understanding relative imports.
- Calling functions and understanding what is returned from a function.

### Questions

The questions are the same in the Python and Java directories.


1. Count how many odd numbers are in an array [`Easy`]
2. Check if password is valid [`Easy`]
3. Weather conditions. Determine which range an integer falls in to. [`Easy`]
4. Identify if a word is a palandrome [`Medium`]
5. Identify most frequent letter in a word and the number of times it occurs [`Hard`]
