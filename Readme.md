# Interview Project

## Note

These are instructions for the interview, not for the candidate. Candidate
instructions are comments in the code.

## Branches

There is a `solution` branch with examples, and a `collaboration` branch with
just the instructions and provided code. Checkout whichever is appropriate in
order to see the test questions.

### Java Project 1

This is for intermediate level candidates (L3 testers, some L2 testers). It
tests their ability to work in a somewhat realistic codebase without being
too information dense, and to read and interpret instructions. The logic is
actually pretty light.

### Java Project 2

This is for junior level candidates (L1, some L2 testers). It tests their
familiarity with some basic data types in Java. Level 1 testers can answer in
pseudo-code if they get tripped up in the logic. There are multiple examples
of how to approach the problems in the `solution` branch, including some unique
approaches that would indicate someone has exceptional experience with Java.

### Python Project 1

This is a mirror of `Java Project 1` written in Python. Testers that claim to
have familarity with Python should be able to handle relative imports and OOP
concepts.

### Python Project 2

This is similar to `Java Project 2`. It's best for L1 and some L2 testers with
python experience. It looks for familarity with basic python data types. There
are a few examples in the `solution` branch, including unique approaches that
would indicate someone has exceptional experience with python.
